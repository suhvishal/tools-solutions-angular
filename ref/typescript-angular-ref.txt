Web application / Web site / front end application/ UI 
------------------------------------------------------

HTML 
    - "what" contents you want to place on your webpage 
    - define the structure of your webpage 

CSS  - cascading style sheet 
    - "how" content should appear on the webpage 
    - define "style rules" for webpages 

JavaScript 
-----------
    - it is a client-side scripting language 
    - it is used to provide programming functionalities on webpages 
    - javascript is a interpreted language 
    - every browser i.e chrome, mozilla, IE has a "javascript engine"
        - JS engine is reponsible to execute javascript code inside the browser 

            Google Chrome       === V8
            mozilla firefox     === Spider monkey 
            IE                  === Chakra 
            Opera 
            ...
            ...

    - 1997, javascript was introduced 
    - 1997, it was submitted to ECMA for standardization 
    - since then ECMA keeps publishing diff specifications / standards 
            - all the browsers are supposed to implement these specifications 
            - the implementation of these specifications is called 'ECMAScript'

            - 1997  : ES1 
            - 1998  : ES2 
            - 1999  : ES3 
            - 2009  : ES5

            - 2015  : ES6 / ECMASCript 2015

            - 2016
            - 2017
            - 2018
            - 2019
            - 2020  : ES11 


    - using javascript....
            - form validations

        - async ans await 
        - generators 
        - **classes and objects

        - ....
        - ...


ES6 Tools 
---------------
    1. Transpiler 
            - convert the advanced scripts into legacy scripts 
                i.e. Es6 code into ES5 code 

            - Babel 

    2. Bundler 
            - bundles several files together and creates a single 
                    compressed file 
            
            - Webpack 

JQuery 
    - it is just a javascript library 
    - it simplifies some javasript tasks 
    - open source / light weight / cross-browser js library 

Bootstrap / SemantiUI
    - to create responsive webpages 
    - it is library for css

    **JavaScript is not typesafe 

    TypeScript Language 
    ----------------------
        - it is developed by Microsoft 
        - it is superset of ES6 
        - it has all the features of ES6 + some additional features 
            - typescript is typesafe 
                - it uses 'types'
            - typescript has some more features 
                    - supports generics i.e. you can create generic clsses, methods, etc.
                    - supports 'Decorators'
                    - ...

        - typescript is a compiled language
        - we cannot execute typescript inside the browser 
        - we have to convert ts code into js code 

                > tsc 


    Environment Setup for typescript 
    ---------------------------------------

        1. install NodeJS 
                - 'npm' will be installed automatically along with node 
                - 'npm' is a dependency management tool 

        2. Editor / IDE 
            - Visual Studio Code 

        3. npm install -g typescript 



        Declare variables in typescript 
        ---------------------------------

            var keyword 
                - global or function scoped variables

            let keyword 
                - block scoped or function scoped variables 

            const keyword 
                - block scoped or function scoped variables 
                - const variables cannot be re-assigned 

        Arrow functions
        -----------------
                - new / more abbreviated way of writing functions in javascript / ES6 

        types 
        ----------

                number 
                string 
                booelan

                void 
                any 

        custom types in typescript 
        ------------------------------

            a. create custom object type  
                - using 'type' keyword
                - using class 
                - using interface

            b. create custom function type 




    Angular Framework 
    ----------------------------  
        - it was introduced in 2010 
        - it was called as angularjs --- it was just a library in the beginning 

         angularjs                           Angular 
        - Angular 1.x                       - angular 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
        - javascript based                  - typescript based 

        - 2016 : Angular 2
        - 2017 ....
        .....
        ...     : Angular 10


   Other frameworks / libraries 
   ----------------------------
        - EmberJS
        - ReactJS
        - VueJS 



Angular 
----------
    - it is a framework for creating client side web applications 
    - the angular framework is distrubuted in the form of diff modules/libraries 

        @angular/core                     
        @angular/compiler             
        @angular/compiler-cli

        @angular/router  
        @angular/forms

    Environment setup  for Angular 
    ----------------------
        1. Install NodeJS 

        2. Editor / IDE 
                - VS Code 
                - Atom, Brackets, Sublime, etc any text editor

        3. install angular-cli 
                - angular cli is a command line tool to manage angular projects 
                - i.e. create/manage/build/deploy angular projects 

                > npm install -g @angular/cli 

                > ng --version


    NPM 
    -------
        - it is a dependency management Tool
        - it comes with nodejs automatically 
        - you can download / install the dependencies locally / globally 


    Angular Building Blocks 
    ----------------------------

        1. Component 
                - component is used to render a particular patch/part  on the screen 
                - component is a class encapsulates data, view and logic together 
                - component controls a template 
                -** every angular app has at-least one component, usually called AppComponent


                    app.component.ts
                    ---------------------

                    import {Component} from '@angualr/core'

                    @Component({
                        selector : 'app-root',
                        templateUrl : 'app.component.html'
                    })
                    class AppComponent {

                    }


                    app.component.html
                    ---------------------
                            - html code to represent the 'view'


                    <app-root></app-root>



                    AppComponent 
                         |
        ---------------------------------------
        Header          Navbar              Courses
                                                |
                                        --------------------


        2. Template 
                - template is a 'view' created using html 



        Create a new angular project 
        -------------------------------

            > ng new helloworld-app 



            header.component.ts 
            ----------------------

            @Component({
                selector: 'app-header',
                templateUrl : 'header.component.html'
            })
            class HeaderComponent{

            }

            header.component.html
            ----------------------
                <div> this is header </div>


            Create a new Component in angular 
            ----------------------------------

                    > ng generate component Header 
                            or 
                    > ng g c Header 

            Data Binding 
            -----------------
                - communication between component and template 

                1. string interpolation 
                        - {{ fieldname }}
                        - used to output dynamic text into div, headings, paragraphs etc. 

                2. property binding 
                        - used to bind a value of a 'field' (data member declared in component ) to dom property of an element 

                            <element [domProperty]="fieldname" />

                            <img [src] = "imageUrl" />

                3. Event Binding 
                        - used to bind a handler method to listen to dom event 
                        - i.e. mouse events, key events, form events etc.
